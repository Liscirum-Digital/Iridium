# Iridium
The Iridium Chat platform provides open, secure and anonymous communication for everyone.  

This project is a new effort to restore freedom and independence on the Internet. If we want to preserve and reclaim our liberties, we need private and secure platforms.  
The open source and free (as in freedom _and_ free beer) platform allows fully encrypted and anonymous communication whilst being independent from large corporations and profit motives.  
The Iridium Chat is also usable with any browser and thus, can be accesed from anywhere, at anytime and by anyone.  

No installation, no registration, no data theft.  

## Why should I use Iridium?
Freedom. Anonymity. Portability.  
As an open source project funded by donations, Iridium is one of the few platforms (apart from e. g. Signal or Wire) that enables _truly_ free and independent communication.  
The advantages distinguishing this project from others of its kind are the possibility of anonymous usage as well as the portability that Iridium offers.  
In order to use the platform, you don't need to provide a credit card or telephone number; you don't have to reveal your email adress. As a result, no connection between your Iridium account and your real life identity can be established; tracking becomes (almost) impossible.  
Another important factor is the project's high portability. Your device has a browser? It has Iridium. While tedious installation and registration processes stunt many communication platforms and reinforce the network effect, Iridium breaks this vicious circle due to it's blazingly fast availability on _any_ device. Using Iridium is a matter of seconds - new ways of communication can be established almost instantly.

(Oh, and as a nice bonus, the project is written in Rust for lightning-fast performance and maximum efficiency.)

## How can I use Iridium?
As the project is still under development, no application has been deploye yet. We are working hard to enable the usage of the Iridium Platform and are grateful for any help.

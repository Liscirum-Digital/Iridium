# Iridium
The Iridium Chat platform provides open, secure and anonymous communication for everyone.  

This project is a new effort to restore freedom and independence on the internet. If we want to preserve and take back our liberties, we need private and secure platforms.  
The open source and free (as in freedom _and_ free beer) platform enables fully encrypted and anonymous communication whilst being independent from large firms and profit motives.  
The Iridium Chat is also usable with any browser and thus, can be used anywhere, anytime and by anyone.  

No installation, no registration, no data theft.  

## Why should I use Iridium?
Freedom. Anonymity. Portability.  
As an open source project funded by donations, Iridium is one of the few platforms that enable _really_ free and independent communication (apart from e. g. Signal or Wire).  
The advantages differentiating this project from others of it's kind are the possibility of anonymous usage as well as the portability Iridium provides.  
In order to use the platform, you don't need to provide a credit card or telephone number; you don't have to reveal your e-mail adress. Thus, no connection between your Iridium account and your real life identity can be established; tracking becomes (almost) impossible.  
Another important factor is the project's high portability. Your device got a browser? It got Iridium. While tedious installation and registration processes stunt many communication platforms and consolidate the network effect, Iridium breaks this vicious circle due to it's blazingly fast availability on _any_ device. Using Iridium is a matter of seconds - new ways of communication can be established almost instantly.

## How can I use Iridium?
As the project is under development, no application has been deployed. We are working fiercly to enable the usage of the Iridium Platform and are grateful for any help.
